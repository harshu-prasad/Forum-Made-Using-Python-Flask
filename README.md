## Technologies used
For frontend we have extensively used Bootstrap. For Backend we have used Python Flask
## Application Structure
The Application Structure of this forum is exactly how a large scale Flask project should have. The amazing Structure of the files and folders of this application makes it a very useful resource to structure one's future large Flask Projects. I personally will use the structure and also some code of this project as code snippets for future projects.
## Advanced Routing of this Application
This project doesn't have that simple routing of a small Flask project but it uses Blueprints methods to create and register routes of this application. You should not learn this code pieces but instead use the code of this project as a Flask cheatsheet to structure and write code in future Flask projects.
